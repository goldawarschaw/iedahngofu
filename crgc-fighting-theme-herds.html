                            <p> I'm trying to think of theme for the characters of my combat game. Examples: ninjas, animals, sumo wrestlers.(not robots) I'd like to use something original that's not overplayed. Any ideas? PS the game is modeled after super smash bros but I know I can't use those kind of characters. To set the scene: A well known athletic shoe store is having its annual big sale with 40% off regular priced shoes and an additional 50% off already marked down clearance. My husband works a physical job, has foot problems, and this particular brand of shoes keeps his pain to a minimum. He does go through shoes quickly due to the miles he puts on them, and what he walks through as he does, so we always watch for this sale to stock up. He is also a smaller guy - he is 40 and covered in tattoos. As game 2 is only getting Lord Packs (I’m hoping those Campaign Packs are saved for Game 3), it seems logical to make a thread discussing what these could be (and what we would mostly want out of them). I’ll use this thread to make the two I would specifically like to see. Of course, add your own ideas below (I’m shorting down the lore pieces for size and quicker reading-I’ll link the Wiki if you want to read up on the character or unit). As additional help, I’ll post this comment Updated 5.9.2019 7:45 cst # Thank You for Your Help hotredpepper1, DeneralGegenerate (several times), artfulguy63, mjmannella (several times), MrBellcaptain, Tobart188 (several times), BestInSlotYoutube, kylachanelle.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST. ## Ending. >“You’re not,” she flared. “You’ll never be.”His face darkened. “I am. I’m your father, and I can marry you to whoever I like. To anyone. You’ll marry the pig boy if I say so, and bed down with him in the sty.” His green eyes glittered with amusement. (ASOS, Sansa III) This nice little dialogue happens shortly before Sansa’s marriage to Tyrion and there might be a deeper meaning behind this allusion. Please bear with me, when I try to unravel the connection to fairy tales While I was watching the show last night and seeing army I found myself wondering why are they making a stand in Winterfell? The theme was that the old ways do not matter so why does holding the castle matter? What good comes from fighting at Winterfell in the winter against a foe that is ice aspected? I am on mobile so sorry for any grammar or format errors. Basically choosing to fight here adds significant handicaps to the defenders while aiding the Army of the Dead. 1. The dothraki 
Hello everyone and welcome to another day of Album of the Year 2018, the daily write-up series where users from /r/hiphopheads talk their favorite albums of the year. Up today, I'm writing about the long-anticipated third studio album from Thebe Kgositsile, the artist professionally known as Earl Sweatshirt, Some Rap Songs  Artist: Earl Sweatshirt (https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/11/28/28-earl-sweatshirt.w570.h712.jpg) Album: Some Rap Songs (https://images-n. Okay listen up, because I have something really important that I’ve wanted to share with you guys for a long time. It will take some time to explain, but, this is just really important to me, so if you would take the time to read through this I would really appreciate it. I know it’s a lot, but please, just give it a chance. While Sonic Adventure 2 may seem, from the outside, to be just another middling 3D action game with a tacked on story, this is hardly the case. In fact, it is just a shell. After giving the game some time to marinate and for me to delve into it properly (acquiring the platinum trophy and exploring gameplay mechanics), I have decided to compose a list of my thoughts on KH3. I am in no means bashing the series as it's my favourite of all time and I've stayed invested in the series in its entirety since 2003. I just want to articulate my thoughts on KH3 as of right now and potentially open some discussion regarding it. I have points of praise and contention Greatest negative k for this week: -6018 with 69 posts, by /u/jarjarbinks213 ^( k or "delta k" refers to the total change in karma ) Lowest average karma per comment: -131 with 5 posts, by /u/jockerbot9000 ### #1 Author: /u/Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game ^(Avg. this week = -14 per comment) Score: -1004 Subreddit: /r/confessions Link (https://np.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/bpmwox/i_tell_everyone_the_reason_i_do_beekeeping_as_a/en. # The Huntress (Melee and Crossbow stealth build) This is my first ever post as well as my first ever build. English was my first language and I'm sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, I'm also Australian so we spell things different to America and other countries anyway. Summary: The Huntress uses stealth as her main tool in combat. The crossbow is the main weapon but rifles and melee weapons are included in the build. She'll be able to upgrade and craft strong melee and ranged weapon. So, another column of thoughts about the.welp. new meta now.as usual, easy to find topics, with a TL;DR at the end. This is more a reaction to the patch and its precedents, and I’ll have more deckbuilding meta thoughts in the near future. TGP told me to post this here, since it's less deck/meta related, but more meta-meta. OVERALL PATCH SENTIMENT—BUFFS GOOD, NERFS BAD: now, a heads up—a lot of criticism is going to take place in this post. But it isn’t because I’m necessarily disappo. The Problem If philosophy is the study of "fundamental problems" then it is about the fundamental problems of humanity itself which includes many domains of investigation. The fundamental human problem of the present is how to save humanity from its seemingly inevitable destruction. This is going to take a HUGE philosophical engine to drive it, one never before been built - but has been in the process of being built by every single line of philosophical inquiry, from the study of philosophy. As the title says, I need some help coming up with names for my Imperial Guard regiment's and lore elements. If there's a more appropriate sub for this, please point me in the right direction, apologies and thank you :) I have most of the actual lore down the way I want it, just need more interesting names, though I will gladly accept input on that as well if you have critique or additional ideas. I'll be using the boring uninspired names I have right now as placeholders here. I'm looking for games where the music 'reacts' to what's happening ingame, in some way. for example In Tekken 7, many stages have a more intense 'final round' theme that kicks in when someone's on their last life Them's Fightin' Herds mixes in bits of each fighter's themes depending on who's winning. Pokemon B/W changes to a different battle theme when the Gym Leader you're fighting is down to their last pokemon. 
There are a lot of things working against the first Witcher game from the start. At the time of release this was yet another fantasy RPG made using another company's engine developed by a (then unknown) Polish developer incorporating an IP that had stopped being popular in the only countries it was ever popular in. That's not counting the lack of character customisation, unintuitive controls, and uncanny valley NPCs. So how the bloody hell did this game spawn a franchise so successful that peopl. My Crazy story part 3 So now I’m headed toward these guys and I’m thinking that this must be the guy, more than anything, I really wanted it to be and to my surprise it was. At first it was awkward and I introduced myself and gave a brief description as to what I was up too, I told him that I had been looking for him for two days now and that I was so happy to meet him I said my burn was starting to crash and that I had heard from this chick that I might find you here, they were listening. T-Series's ruses are so rife with ignorance, erroneous information, and poorly conceived notions of parochialism that I hardly know where to begin. Even disregarding obvious errors like its insistence that statism brings one closer to nirvana, the fallacies of its claims are glaring to those of us who have educated ourselves about the implications of recidivism. Let me preface my discussion by quickly reasserting a familiar theme of my previous letters: Its prank phone calls were never about. The Ancient Roman army is after a new Tribune, and in Roman Tribune by Konami, players are given the chance to get their hands on the very fortunate title. Once is a one-off, twice is a coincidence, three times is a trend and so what is the fourth time in a row? Not good, when we’re talking about those darn rocks. Jihad as Islamic reform.
