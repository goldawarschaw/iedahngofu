Okay, so, to start off, I have been using Ad Aware for quite some time, but I hadn't seen a definitions update in about a year and a half, so I figured maybe it was time to try something else. So I decided to give Malwarebytes a try. For some daft reason (I guess because I've never had an issue this extensive before) I didn't create a restore point before the install. But after that, and a Windows update, I'm now stuck with a few large issues.

Hey guys/girls! I met with hardship after making a fresh install of a 2in1 tablet. It's a totally fresh install from a windows 10 32bit home version I have freshly downloaded from Microsoft, all gone smoothly after that, got the SOC driver up, everything is in order minus the sound. What happens: Under the devices an Intel SST wdm device, and a Nuvoton sst nau88l24 codec appears, all seemingly in working order, at least according to windows, however there are no actual sound in and outputs. Hello everyone, I loved MGO2, and I like MGO3, but let's face it, it's dying. However, I think that it can be saved. Now that summer break has started, I have been playing MGO3 much more frequently and to my dismay it is on it's way out. I want to save it, some of my favorite gaming moments ever were on MGO2 and I think MGO3 has a lot of potential to be a great game if Kojima made the needed fixes and Konami would support it's most likely dire need of funding. I have worked with most 3 letter agencies (and currently) doing computer forensics and other computer security tasks. Ask away!

I use a write block when I grab an image so I don't accidentally touch any of the files and alter their time stamp. Windows 10 doesn't support ORF files (Olympus RAW) out of the box, which is frankly a little absurd. They have a camera codec pack that can be downloaded and installed, however it is incompatible with Win 10 and using Compatibility Mode yields no positive results. I see special media codec packs available on various websites, but only if you're willing to fork out money for it. This seems ridiculous. Is there no convenient and free way that Oly users can see their RAW files in the Explorer. </p>
