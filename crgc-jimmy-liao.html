Hello again, Seven months ago I posted the first incarnation of this list (well, my first public incarnation) on this subreddit. I mentioned then that I had thoughts of working this list into book form. Well, those thoughts have become a partial manuscript, extensive research, and long nights telling my wife I just want to finish this one biography or one chapter…plus I work a rather more than 40 hour job, so this is all done in the cracks and gaps in my real life. 
Happy new year, first of all. I've posted on here twice in the past year, to show off the latest incarnations of my "leader list", my slightly dumb hobby of identifying and ranking the greatest military commanders in history. My last two posts can be found at the following links, for reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5ykj3a/the_top_100_commanders_of_history_my_list_a_long/ https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/764ned/the_300_greatest_commanders_of_history/ #### Launch credits: This list likely just the launch credits as at Nov 2012. It doesn't cover all the work done under a huge team at SOE, and the team at Daybreak up till now, December 2017. It doesn't include PS1 team and their legacy. Probably misses a whole bunch of others who helped out but are not included. Executive Producer: Josh Hackney Producer:Ryan Wells Project Manager:David Carey, Shad Halsey, Jason Good Techni. Hello everyone. I have learned Vue.js for a few months. I think v\-model and Vuex are good features, but we can't use them together really well \(Vuex Doc: https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/forms.html (https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/forms.html)\) So I try to create vuex\-model\-helper and try to improve developing experience. Here is the example: https://github.com/LiaoJimmy/vuex\-model\-helper (https://github.com/LiaoJimmy/vuex-model-helper) Hope you like this helper and please give me some suggestio. Hello all, For a long time now I've been working on a Top 100 Commanders of history list, something I hope turns into a book. (As a dedicated amateur historian, a man can dream can't he?) I've always been fascinated by leadership and personality in military history, and how much it can swing historical events one way or another. After much refining, research, interesting little threads and eddies that took me into some very obscure history, I think I've come up with a list. When putting togeth.

What’s good Reddit, after a very busy few weeks, I’m back to give a few updates about our club. Since the last picture I’ve been promoted to a club officer and made the social events coordinator for osu! UCI. Membership has been going up and we’re quickly gathering more and more members across campus. We all still have weekly meetings, featuring presentations about many aspects of the game such as learning how to storyboard and making sense of the PP ranking systems. Online lobbies are still.  Upvote for Visibility --- Hey everyone, Below are the team assignments and schedule for everyone signed up for the Redditland cooperative parks. We had a total of 49 slots filled, with 45 individual participants. It's a great turnout, and I'm really happy with the response. I hope you guys are as excited to get working on this as I am! On some of the parks, there will be specific items I ask that you obtain (if you don't already have them). These will help the park sharing process World News UK: Clamp down on lads' mags to avoid 'pornification' of society, says study ( "The report, by psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, warns that the "pornification" of society has put both girls and boys under unprecedented pressure to conform to gender stereotypes from a younger and younger age."
